## 2014-08-03: New website!

I finally decided to give Virt.js a real website to host some documentation. I spent a bit of time on choosing the right framework to do so, and finally kept [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/). For reference, I chose not to use standard plugins in order to be able to configure the website generation exactly as I wanted to. You can find it [here](https://github.com/virtjs/virtjs.github.io/blob/master/_metalsmith/metalsmith.js), the code is pretty neat.

I'm now going to work a bit more on the emulator itself - as you may have noticed, the version described in the website articles is not yet published. So first priority is to finish the Gameboy engine, which shouldn't take too long, then write an engine for another console.
