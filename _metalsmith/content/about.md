# About Virtjs

Virtjs is an emulation library. More than a simple emulator, it gives you full leverage on the running emulator, which means that you can see (and alter) register states, hook memory read / write, wire your own input & output devices, and much more.

The current Virtjs library has only a single engine (Gameboy), but its engine repository should grow as the months pass. In the meantime, feel free to report bugs about the current engine, and discuss which one should be the next!

We're always looking for contributors, so should you feel interested about emulation, I think you could be a great asset for the project!
